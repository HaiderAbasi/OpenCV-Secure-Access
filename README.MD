Secure Access System
--------------------

This is a Python-based secure access system that uses facial recognition and tracking to authenticate authorized personnel.

Features
------------
- Only allow device/premises access 🔓 to authorized individuals. 

- Annoy 😠 kids away by disrupting their mouse/keyboard commands. 
- Lockout crucial files/folders 🚫 from specified individuals. 
> (To-do)
    - Gather complete activity-data for selected users. 

Requirements
------------
To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

- opencv-contrib-python==4.4.0.46
- dlib
- face_recognition

You can install these packages by running the following command:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> Tested only on **Windows10**.

Usage
-----
To activate the secure access system, call the `activate_sa` method of the `secure_access_cv` class with the following arguments:

- `vid_id`: The ID of the camera/webcam device to capture frames from or the path of the video file to use.
- `dataset_dir`: The path to the directory containing the folders of image/s of authorized personnel to use for training the face recognition model.

Here's an example:

```python
from core import secure_access_cv

sas = secure_access_cv()
sas.activate_sa(vid_id=0, dataset_dir="authorized_personnels")
```


File structure
------------
The main file of the secure access system is core.py, which contains the secure_access_cv class.

Thank you 👏 [ageitgey](https://github.com/ageitgey).

Your work has made using face recognition  in projects a walk in the park. 

Also, thanks to [Davis King](https://github.com/davisking) ([@nulhom](https://twitter.com/nulhom)) for creating dlib and for providing the trained facial feature detection and face encoding models used in this library.

Keep the OpenSource torch lit! 🔥
