# OpenCV_Secure Access

## Overview
OpenCV_Secure Access is a Python project that demonstrates how to use OpenCV to perform face recognition on a directory of images, and how to save matched images to a new directory.

## Setup
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 and OpenCV installed on your system. You can install OpenCV using pip:

pip install opencv-python

## Usage
1. Set the path to the directory containing the images in the `image_dir_path` variable in the `main.py` file.
2. Set the path to the image containing the individual to search for in the `search_image_path` variable in the `main.py` file.
3. Run the `main.py` file to perform face recognition and save matched images to a new directory.
